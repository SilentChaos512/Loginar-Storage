# Loginar Storage

Loginar Storage aims to improve inventory management by adding new ways to store and transport items. The mod is meant to "fit in" with vanilla, while also being useful in a heavily modded environment.

### Note on Downloads

**I only upload builds to Minecraft CurseForge.** If you downloaded the mod from somewhere other than Curse/CurseForge or the Twitch launcher (or as part of a modpack in some cases), I cannot make any guarantees about the file or its contents, as it was uploaded without my permission.
