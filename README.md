### Note on Downloads

**I only upload builds to Minecraft CurseForge.** If you downloaded the mod from somewhere other than Curse/CurseForge or the Twitch launcher (or as part of a modpack in some cases), I cannot make any guarantees about the file or its contents, as it was uploaded without my permission.
